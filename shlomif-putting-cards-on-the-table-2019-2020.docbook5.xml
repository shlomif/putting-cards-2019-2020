<info><title>Introduction</title></info>

<para>
This essay aims to present a summary of a snapshot as of 2019 of my personal
philosophy and ideology, titled
<link xlink:href="http://www.shlomifish.org/me/rindolf/#rindolfism">Rindolfism</link>,
which is dynamic and subject to change.
</para>

<para>
It largely builds upon a previous essay titled <link xlink:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/">“Putting all the Cards on the Table (2013)”</link>
</para>

<para>
I am really tired of having truly intellectual people like me "speak in
riddles" and be somewhat dishonest, so I'd like to put as many of the cards I
have now on the table. There will likely be more into the future, and moreover,
honesty is a process and a person should strive to become more honest as time
goes by.

<title>"Live and let live; do and let do"</title>
</info>

<para>
While it had earlier occurrences, I derive this piece of wisdom from <link
xlink:href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Saladin_Style/">Saladin</link>,
a Muslim king and conqueror of Kurdish descent who is known for being one
of the most effective warriors, and one of the most noble and merciful people in
history.
</para>

<para>
During Saladin's time <link
xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region)">Palestine</link>
which is also known as "The Land of Israel" or "The Holy Land" was ruled and
terrorised by the <link
xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_Templar">Knights
Templar</link>. These were Christian conquerors originating from Europe, who
were psychotic, psychopathological, vicious, sadistic, and vandals, who would
have put <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany">the
Nazis</link> much less today's <link
xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda">Al-Qaeda</link> or <link
xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant">ISIL</link>
to shame, and harmed the civilians in Palestine and were feared by them.
</para>

<para>
Saladin acquired a large army of loyal warriors, who all joined him by choice,
had superior swords to those of the Knights Templar, and lighter armour, and he
set out to release Palestine from the Knights fortress by fortress.  But the
most amazing thing is that he told the knights something like that:
</para>

<blockquote>

<para>

You can fight me or you can surrender. The choice is yours. Do what you want,
you don't have to do what you think you must. If you choose to surrender, I
will spare your life, disarm you and let you walk to Christian-controlled
territory. If you choose to fight, I will try my best not to kill or harm you,
and then swear you not to fight me any more, and let you walk to
Christian-controlled territory.

</para>

<para>

I trust you will make the right decision and entrust you with power.
Whatever your choice will be, I'll accept it.

</para>

</blockquote>

<para>
While some knights were probably killed, many of them survived and became
happy, sane, and while ostensibly Christian, unwilling to fight Saladin.  Even
if their religious leaders told them to return, Saladin told them he is OK with
the oath breaking and said he'll fight them again. This caused his Knights
Templar opponents to fight extremely poorly, and be quickly disarmed.
Following that, they learned their lesson, and would not fight Saladin again.
</para>

<para>
By letting people do what they want, they will likely do the best thing
they can do. This is management by not managing and parenting by not
parenting, which is and always was the best way.
</para>

<section xml:id="big-minded-vs-small-minded">
<info>
<title>Big minded ("Rosh gadol") vs. Small minded ("Rosh qatan")</title>
</info>
<para>
The Israeli military was small and as there was a lot of work to do
to properly secure the Israeli civilians it coined the terms
<link xlink:href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2004/12/06/news-45/">Rosh
gadol ("big minded") and Rosh qatan ("small minded")</link>
to encourage the soldiers to take initiative and try to perform their
jobs as well as possible, regardless of the fact they were paid little.
</para>
<para>
This extends to non-military work, government work, and voluntary work
or hobbies and endeavours: if you care about something, do it as well
as possible and give it enough time as needed. It will get easier and
faster in time.
</para>

<para>
For instance, a vendor on a candy store or an icecream parlour, should
try to greet the customers, be friendly to them, offer recommendations
to them if they ask, accept business cards with their personal web
sites or social media presence and visit them, and generally treat
every customer like royalty.
</para>

<para>
If you do this, you'll likely get more returning customers, bigger tips,
bigger bonuses and raises, and you may be able to land a better job
based on a warm recommendation from your superiors and coworkers.
</para>

<para>
The opposite is just following orders blindly, "I just work here"
attitude, which is no different from the Nazis'
<link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_orders">Superior
orders - "I was only following orders"</link> which leads to laziness,
stagnation, vandalism and sadism, just like the German Nazis in World
War II, or the Knights Templar in Saladin's time.
</para>

<para>
As an extension of big-mindedness, one may opt to <emphasis role="bold">refuse orders</emphasis>
completely. Despite common belief, this should not cause anarchy, but
rather bring peace and posterity.

It should get quicker and easier and the results will be better and
more "professional" in due time.
</para>

<para>
In the book <link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Musketeers">The
Three Musketeers</link>, Dumas tells the story of how d’Artagnan who is a young
swordsman without much of an official training, from a remote region of France,
eventually becomes the best fighter in France. This is despite the fact that
his peers, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, have much more experience and training.
</para>

<para>
It may seem farfetched, but before the industrialisation of the Far East,
and the way the West interpreted martial arts, with the coloured belts and
all, there were regional masters of these arts, who practised them as much as
they could and honed their skills. However, despite all that, they never ruled
out that they would one day fight against someone who never fought before,
and lose.
</para>

<para>
It took me more than a year to write <link
xlink:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/TheEnemy/">The Enemy and How I

two weeks to write <link

lesser songs before that.

As you may have read, <link
xlink:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/#david_and_goliath">David
who fought Goliath was a hacker</link> and it was modernised in <link
xlink:href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anEuw8F8cpE">the famous
scene from Indiana Jones</link> where Indy shoots a master swordsman
using a gun instead of struggling with him. Hacking or heroism involves
breaking or bending as many invisible rules as possible and not
accepting your "fate" (which is usually death) and this applies both to
fiction and to real life.
</para>

<para>
The opposite of hacking is conformism where you accept all the
normative rules of society, fear your own shadow, and stagnate and die,
possibly by <link
xlink:href="https://studybible.info/ABP_Strongs/Judges%2016:30">taking
many innocent people's lives with you</link>.

As a result, eccentricity and "craziness" are the road to a happy life,
not conformism as widely believed.

A great hacker is an action hero that is aware enough of the essence of
hacking to become a greater and greater hacker, despite whatever

may run into.

Note that some great hackers were clearly fictional (e.g:

<title>The Fox in the Chickens Coop</title>
</info>

<para>
Despite common belief what happens when you put a great hacker (whether
male or female) in a secluded place with many minor hackers or
conformists, is not one crushed great hacker, but rather many great
hackers, who spend time effort and conscious thought on satisfying
their customers, peers and superiors. That is the "fox in a chickens'
coop" motif as exemplified in <link
xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_(Genesis)">the story
of Joseph in prison in the Bible</link>, and that of <link
xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milady_de_Winter">Milady de

(pardon the pun) who devours the hens of the fictionalised NSA.

<para>
I, Shlomi Fish, have done the same in real life in a top security
Israeli psychiatric ward where I was hospitalised for being non
normative, and for doing some foolish stuff. It worked surprisingly
well, and I've used the collected wisdom of Moses→Saladin→Ayn Rand→the
Beatles→Sesame Street→web 2.0 blogs and sites→My Little Pony / Taylor
Swift and my own intuition and trial and error.
</para>


<para>
It took me about 6-to-8 weeks, and I suffered from the conditions of the
hospital, but otherwise was able to hone my skills in benevolent psychological
warfare, and also started writing some essays with my limited computing
resources there.

<title>The Hacker Kings / Hacker Queens / Kings of Kings / King Messiahs / Best of the Best of the Best / Hacker Monarchs</title>
</info>

<para>
Traditionally in history, some great hackers have been motivated enough
to change the world or improve it, and let no obstacle permanently
stop them. They have become so powerful
that they took over the direction of the world and together with some
collaborators and supporters became
sources of greatness. This is even though some of them were clearly
or presumably fictional.
</para>

<para>
In <link
xlink:href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Nagus">the
article about the Grand Nagus in Star Trek DS9</link>, Quark is quoted
as saying  «Oh believe me, the Nagus has the greatest business mind in
the entire Ferengi Alliance, always thinking ten, sometimes twenty
steps ahead of everyone else.» and this is similar for a hacker monarch
who is often ahead of the curve.

<para>
Following the <link
xlink:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/me/rindolf/#update_long_live_us_hacker_monarchs">Summer
Glau "termination"</link>, it was believed that there now can be many
simultaneous hacker monarchs, and that people can try to become ones while not
dethroning (or <link
xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic_transit_gloria_mundi">sic transit
gloria mundi</link>) the previous hacker monarchs. <quote>We don’t die. We multiply.</quote>
</para>

<para>
A hacker monarch believes that the correct answer to the question "Who is the
most powerful person on Earth?" is "I am". Furthermore, the only less powerful
people are those who answer otherwise.
</para>

<para>
Note that even a hacker monarch may be fallible. Socrates almost got himself
killed several times, and then he willingly drank the poison and died.
Plato and Aristotle
said equally blasphemous things, but learned from Socrates' fate and worked on
a better delivery so both died as highly revered and respected. The same story
repeated itself during the Renaissance with Galileo and Isaac Newton.
</para>

<para>
Many Hacker Monarchs were two steps forward and one step back, like the fact
Ayn Rand was <link xlink:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/#honesty">anti-Open</link> and
<link xlink:href="#amateurs">anti-Amateur</link> and <link
xlink:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=neo-tech-selfishness">confused
selfishness with rational self growth</link>.
</para>

<para>
Moreover, I still resent the fact that the characters in
<emphasis>Buffy</emphasis> were competent, but on the other hand socially inept
and lacked sexual assertiveness. This is a false dichotomy that I tried to
rectify in <link xlink:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/stories/">my
stories and screenplays</link> where the characters are both competent and
socially capable.
</para>

<para>
Having read <link
xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Musketeers"><emphasis>The
Three Musketeers</emphasis></link>, Dumas’ magnum opus, I recall feeling
intimated by the competence and resourcefulness of <link
xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milady_de_Winter">Milady de
Winter</link>, until I eventually realised that despite being the antagonist,
or because of that, she was the ultimate good in the book, and she became my
epitome of sexiness in fiction. I disliked the fact that Dumas killed her so much, that
I set out to carve different destinies for her in <link
xlink:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/"><emphasis>Selina
Mandrake - The Slayer</emphasis></link> and for <link

So if you have a criticism against even the greatest hackers, voice it - we

of screenplays and stories was what I described as <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staccato">"staccato"</link> where I do not

<title>Sexiness as Competence</title>

<para>
Now here is something interesting: there is a strong correlation between
how able you are and how sexually desirable you are to
members-of-the-appropriate-sexes (MOTAS) (who may still be attracted to you
whether or not you or they are in a relationship.).
</para>

<para>
Furthermore, <link
xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_(biology)">fitness in
biology</link> in humans corresponds more to sexual attractiveness than to
<link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness">physical
fitness</link>. In the United Kingdom, the adjective "fit" has started to mean
"sexy", "hot", "attractive" or "desirable" including such MOTAS who are not
too athletic.
</para>


<para>
Some people may still think that sexual attractiveness is indicative of
incompetence and bad form, but the opposite is true. Back when I referred a
deaf friend of mine to the video <link
xlink:href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21uXcvD5lPs">Daily Gradvice</link>
(tongue-in-cheek sex/love/etc. advice by <link
xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Helbig">Grace Helbig</link>) he
complained that the quality of the subtitles there (which were generated by
automatic <link

for that because I knew she was a wonderful lady and that was <emphasis

that.

The end of the story is that I told my friend that I would try to prepare
better subtitles which he and others would be able to use. While his original
insulting delayed that, I eventually yielded <link

<title>Taylor Swift</title>
</info>

<para>
We were <link
xlink:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=sharp-gnu--think-big">discussing</link>
Apple's <link
xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)">Swift
language</link> the other day on the <link
xlink:href="irc://irc.freenode.net/#gnu">#gnu</link> chat room on freenode
when I told someone there that he should charge 300 USD/hour for Swift
projects because he disliked them so much. I also said the high fee may
yield <link
xlink:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=joel-camels-rubber-duckies-11">a
higher demand</link>.  Then, since I had a browser window open with the most
followed
Twitter accounts and <link
xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift">Taylor Swift</link>
was there, I noted she likely charges more than 300 USD/hour for her
live shows. He told me that she shared her name with that language, and I
noted that she should sue Apple for trademark violations of the supposed
"Swift" trademark - and win.  I joked that if "Apple sued Taylor Swift for
violation of their Apple Swift language's trademark they will spend all
their money in the bank on litigation and still lose.". Ha ha only serious.
</para>
<para>
I then realised that Ms. Swift has become a <link
xlink:href="#hacker-monarchs">Hacker Queen</link> by that time. While I
think her face is good eye candy, she is not that beautiful in my opinion
(but I think she looks <link
xlink:href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdneKLhsWOQ">much hotter with
black hair</link> than with her trademark blonde hair). Nevertheless, there
are many things we can learn from her.
</para>

<para>
First of all is that she exemplifies the <link
xlink:href="#amateurs">amateur model</link>, because she does stuff for
fun, rather than for money.
</para>

<para>
Her videos despite often being popular probably do not offset their
production value in ads, but they are good publicity, provide fodder
for remixes, parodies and covers, and are fun enough to produce so she
can afford to offset the cost. She doesn't work for money or even for a
shitload of money. She works for fun.
</para>

<para>
Moreover, Taylor is an unapologetic <link
xlink:href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/attention_whore">"attention
whore"</link> who often spends large amounts of money or even also time
in activities that will make her look like a better person	or more
well known.
</para>

<para>
Otherwise, Taylor Swift is a great philanthropist who likely <link
xlink:href="https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1175578541292957696">also
donates to friendly individuals</link> and realises that one should <link
xlink:href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-1.htm">"cast your bread
upon the waters"</link> to quote the wonderful Biblical scroll of <link
xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastes">Ecclesiastes</link>.
</para>

<para>
One advice I can give to Ms. Swift is to stop "speaking in riddles"
which was also an issue of <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett">Terry Pratchett’s books</link>, and which I was inspired by the
lyrics of
<link xlink:href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNzj55CEoMI">a cover
of Swift's song "Ours"</link> (which I now much malign). I recommend
she start writing a public snapshot of her personal philosophy ("Taytayism"
or whatever) similar to my <link xlink:href="https://github.com/shlomif/putting-cards-2019-2020">repository of this very document</link>.
It can be on GitHub or GitLab, or perhaps Google Docs.
</para>

Another piece of advice is to

an "indie" YouTube channel, but this is not particularly specific to her.

<para>
My <link
xlink:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/#chuck_norris">previous
analysis of Chuck Norris and the Chuck Norris factoids</link> turned out to
not be the last word on the subject. It is well known than Norris took the
facts to his advantage, and as a result became the most prominent actor in
Hollywood (which I call "the Alpha Male"). However, shortly afterwards, the
factoids seem to have fallen out of favour, and some time after that, Norris
announced that he retired from acting.
</para>

<para>
Now, I still added factoids about other subjects <link
xlink:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/">to
my collection</link>. Then one day in 2019, I was chatting on the #gnu chat
room on <link xlink:href="https://freenode.net/">freenode</link> and after
giving someone some advice, I came up with a new factoid which I uttered
there: <quote>If Chuck Norris gives you some advice, and you do not follow
it, he'll survive. However, you likely won't.</quote>. To my surprise
my fellow to the conversation, told me it was funny.  Some days later I
spent some time with my sister's husband, who is an artist and a film
maker, and showed him some of the software applications and web services, which
I was familiar with as a <link
xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux (or rather
    "GNU/Linux")</link> user and developer. Then, just when he and my sister were going
away, I told him I had some factoids on my site about Chuck Norris/etc., and he
told me he was a big fan of those.
</para>

<para>
So what has happened?
</para>

<para>
What I think happened is that Norris started playing (and fighting) in
roles he liked, even if he didn't get paid or got paid relatively little,
or was paid after the fact.  He became a happy <link
xlink:href="#amateurs">amateur</link> rather than an increasingly unhappy
professional. I won't be surprised if he has agreed to appear at local
schools' plays, and/or playing roles that were seemingly unlike his
traditional Hollywood roles - just because he liked them.
</para>

<para>
As a result of that, I believe Chuck Norris, both himself and
the fictionalised Chuck Norris Facts image, has become a
new Hacker Monarch. Well Done!

appropriate sex (or <link

If you are interested in testing the waters for a long-term

<link xlink:href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</link> is a video
sharing site which you've probably heard of. While there are many
official videos by signed artists or by the film owners' copyrights,
there is also a huge ecosystem of original "direct-to-YouTube" art
created by the so called "YouTubers". They upload anything from bootleg
videos of songs, to technical tutorials, to low cost covers (often just
a man or a woman singing and playing a guitar, a piano or even an electric
organ or A cappella), to parodies, to lyric videos, to live recordings
of any musicians or comedians.

Now, some people still look down on YouTubers thinking that covers can never
be better than the original, but having been introduced to the world of
YouTube covers, I can often prove them wrong:

One problem with YouTube is that many videos have been removed, or

YouTube, and while some die hard copyright puritans have looked
down on that, I still support that as a way to battle censorship.

Someone told me in a chat, that he believed that Google (who owns

Capitalism has been getting a bad reputation since Karl Marx published
his book <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital">Das Kapital</link>
or as Neo-Tech put it:
</para>

<blockquote>

<para>
The dictionary definition of capitalism is: An economic system characterized by
private ownership of capital goods and by investments that are determined by
private decision rather than by state control. Prices, production and
distribution of goods are determined by a free market.
</para>
…
<para>
But most writers and commentators put dishonest altruistic-platonistic
connotations on the meaning of capitalism: A system of exploitation of the weak
by the strong -- devoid of love and good will. A system in which unwanted goods
and services are pushed onto consumers through clever, deceptive advertising
for the sole purpose of profits and greed. Capitalism dominates most Western
governments. Capitalism, big business, and fascism are synonymous.

I am no longer a libertarian purist, but I still think Capitalism and
liberalism are the best economic system and political system respectively.

might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up
with a lot of other things, so that he has a difficulty in laying
his hands upon it. Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as
to what he takes into his brain attic. He will have nothing but the
tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a
large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake
to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to
any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every
addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It
is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts
elbowing out the useful ones.&quot;

2 of A Study in Scarlet</link> by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, under the
public domain in most countries.)
</para>
<para>
Conan Doyle was naturally exaggerating here in portraying the ideal of
Sherlock Holmes (as few, if any, human beings can forget that the
Earth revolves around the Sun), but the principle still stands: we
need to make a conscious decision of how to manage our memory, because
there is a limit to how many different aspects can put inside our
resident memory, or otherwise we'll forget more important stuff.
</para>
<para>
So what does it has to do with the Awk programming language? Many
decades after A Study in Scarlet,
<link xlink:href="http://www.catb.org/esr/">Eric S. Raymond</link> had
this to say in his book
<link xlink:href="http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/"><emphasis>The
Art of Unix Programming</emphasis></link>:
</para>
<blockquote>
<para>
A case study of awk is included to point out that it is not a model
for emulation; in fact, since 1990 it has largely fallen out of use.
It has been superseded by new-school scripting languages—notably
Perl, which was explicitly designed to be an awk killer. The reasons
are worthy of examination, because they constitute a bit of a
cautionary tale for minilanguage designers.
</para>
<para>
The awk language was originally designed to be a small, expressive
special-purpose language for report generation. Unfortunately, it
turns out to have been designed at a bad spot on the
complexity-vs.-power curve. The action language is noncompact, but
the pattern-driven framework it sits inside keeps it from being
generally applicable — that's the worst of both worlds. And the
new-school scripting languages can do anything awk can; their
equivalent programs are usually just as readable, if not more so.
</para>
<para>
For a few years after the release of Perl in 1987, awk remained
competitive simply because it had a smaller, faster implementation.
But as the cost of compute cycles and memory dropped, the economic
reasons for favoring a special-purpose language that was relatively
thrifty with both lost their force. Programmers increasingly chose
to do awklike things with Perl or (later) Python, rather than
<emphasis role="strong">keep two different scripting languages in
their heads</emphasis>.[90] By the year 2000 awk had become little
more than a memory for most old-school Unix hackers, and not a
particularly nostalgic one.
</para>
<para>
Falling costs have changed the tradeoffs in minilanguage design.
Restricting your design's capabilities to buy compactness may still
be a good idea, but doing so to economize on machine resources is a
bad one. Machine resources get cheaper over time, but
<emphasis role="strong">space in programmers' heads only gets more
expensive</emphasis>. Modern minilanguages can either be general but
noncompact, or specialized but very compact; specialized but
noncompact simply won't compete.
</para>

<para>
I still keep awk out of my resident memory, but there are many other
things I do not remember nor care enough to. For example, I do not remember
the names of the current Israeli president or that of the current <link

Chief of the General Staff (Israel)</link>. I am almost sure they are
both great people, but remembering their names is pointless for me.
</para>

<para>
We have to manage our memory with care, or we'll forget stuff that is
much more important.

This story has implications for speaking with people who are learning English
or a different foreign language.  Try not to interrupt them on every mistake
they make, and let them speak with some errors, so they will gain confidence.
