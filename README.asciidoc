== Introduction

This essay aims to present a summary of a snapshot as of 2019 of my
personal philosophy and ideology, titled
https://www.shlomifish.org/me/rindolf/#rindolfism[Rindolfism], which is
dynamic and subject to change.

It largely builds upon a previous essay titled
https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/[“Putting
all the Cards on the Table (2013)”]

I am really tired of having truly intellectual people like me "speak in
riddles" and be somewhat dishonest, so I'd like to put as many of the
cards I have now on the table. There will likely be more into the
future, and moreover, honesty is a process and a person should strive to
become more honest as time goes by.
